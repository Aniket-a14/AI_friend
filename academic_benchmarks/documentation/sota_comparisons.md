# 📊 SOTA Comparisons & Empirical Performance Matrix

This document provides a highly rigorous, multi-dimensional empirical comparison matrix contrasting the **AI Friend Multi-Agent Architecture (AI Friend)** against standard humanoid robot platforms and traditional academic architectures. It serves as a drop-in asset for the **Experimental Results and Evaluation** section of an academic manuscript.

> [!NOTE]
> **Scope of Current Development**: The AI Friend architecture represents the **Humanoid Brain** (the cognitive and conversational core). Physical robotic mechanical integration (actuator kinematics, motor control, and body joints) is slated for a future phase. Therefore, all mathematical formulations, evaluations, and comparisons focus exclusively on the cognitive, conversational, and edge computational metrics of the humanoid brain.

## 1. Master SOTA Comparative Matrix

The comparative matrix below evaluates **AI Friend** against 6 state-of-the-art and legacy conversational and mobile robotics platforms across 8 core metrics.

> [!NOTE]
> The "Ours" columns below were independently re-derived from the raw per-sample telemetry in `scripts/results/*.json` (not trusted at face value) — see `scripts/results/benchmark_results_summary.md` for the full verification notes, including two numbers that were previously mislabeled/fabricated and have since been corrected or retracted. **Not every figure is a raw stopwatch measurement**: some (marked ¹²) are *composed estimates* summing independently measured sub-components rather than live end-to-end trials, and some (marked ⁴) are aggregates *independently recomputed* from raw per-sample arrays rather than newly measured — see the per-metric footnotes below the matrix for the provenance class of each value. Accelerated (non-physical) benchmarking mode is intentionally disabled in `hard_benchmark.py`, so that column cannot be populated under the current harness.

## 3. Subsystem Performance Headroom & Latency Pathway

To prevent turn-taking bottlenecks, the sub-LLM pre-processing and emotional appraisal pipeline executes in a fraction of a millisecond, leaving the bulk of the system's frame-rate budget available for generative local LLM tokenization.

### Table II: Pre-LLM / Post-LLM Pipeline Latencies

⁷Sum of all seven measured component latencies (audio ingest/DSP, working-memory read/write, ACT-R vector search, prosody generation, ducking, NATS RTT — see `scripts/results/human_realism_results.json`), not a row-by-row sum of the table above (several rows remain unmeasured individually). Excludes LLM token generation. Throughput figures are derived (1000 / latency_ms), not independently measured op-rate trials.

## 4. Neo4j Knowledge DB Traversal Speed

AI Friend bypasses standard exhaustive O(N) database traversals using unified graph constraints combined with an in-memory **Belief Cache**, achieving scale-invariant retrieval latencies across deep multi-hop semantic networks.

### Table III: Multi-Hop Memory Retrieval Latency
| Traversal Hop Depth | AI Friend Cached (ms) | AI Friend Uncached (ms) | Standard Database (ms) | Performance Speedup |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **1-Hop** | **0.164 ms**⁸ | **0.485 ms**⁹ | 8.50 ms | *(see note)* |
| **2-Hop** | **0.181 ms**⁸ | **0.578 ms**⁹ | 24.20 ms | *(see note)* |
| **3-Hop** | **0.197 ms**⁸ | **0.568 ms**⁹ | 84.60 ms | *(see note)* |

⁸Derived from one measured Redis fetch time (`working_memory_fetch_avg_ms`) scaled by small assumed per-hop multipliers (1.0/1.1/1.2). ⁹Genuinely measured live Neo4j Cypher traversal wall-clock time via `measure_neo4j_traversals()`.
>
> [!WARNING]
> **"Standard Database" is not a benchmarked external system.** Both `human_realism_eval.py` (which produces the Cached/Uncached numbers above) and `extended_benchmarks_eval.py` model this column as an *arbitrary multiplier* applied to the uncached measurement — `human_realism_eval.py` uses ×6.5/×12/×22 (giving ~3.16/6.94/12.49 ms), while `extended_benchmarks_eval.py` falls back to a hardcoded ×~18/×~42/×~149 constant (the 8.50/24.20/84.60 ms shown here) because of a JSON key-path mismatch that silently skips the real data. Neither multiplier is derived from an actually-run competing database. The "Performance Speedup" column is left unfilled rather than publish a multiplier computed against an invented baseline.

Dynamic vocal filler insertion rates (`Words/Turn`) and acoustic markup parsing accuracies are audited under low and high stress scenarios:

### Table IV: Vocal Prosody Accuracies
| State Scenario | AI Friend Tag Precision | Filler Rate (Words/Turn) | Associated Generated Tags |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Low Stress / Calm** | **95.3%** | 0.12 | `[laughs]`, `[nods]` |
| **High Stress / Threat** | **94.4%** | 0.42 | `[sighs]`, `[clears throat]`, `[voice cracks]` |
| **Standard Voice Baseline** | 74.3% | 1.85 | `None` (Static Text-to-Speech) |

## 6. Detailed Academic Discussion of Metrics

### 6.1 Conversational Turn-Taking and Interruption (Barge-in)
Prior cascaded turn-taking architectures suffer from turn gaps between $700\text{ ms}$ and $2500\text{ ms}$ due to silence-timeout voice activity detection (VAD). In contrast, AI Friend implements a parallelized **System 1 VAD interrupt hook** operating directly on the DSP audio buffer. Under a composed latency estimate (100ms audio-buffer assumption + measured NATS RTT + DSP + ducking — not yet a live end-to-end stopwatch trial), AI Friend stops vocal playback within **~104 ms** of user speech onset, which is below the human turn-taking transition threshold of $200.0\text{ ms}$ (*Stivers et al., 2009*).

### 6.2 Goal and Affect Classification Accuracy
The classification accuracy of intent and goals under synthetic stress is plotted in the confusion matrices below:

![Intent classification confusion matrices: industry baseline vs. AI Friend Cognitive Architecture](../../scripts/results/cognitive_confusion_matrix.png)

AI Friend maintains **85.7%** classification accuracy (N=1000, independently recomputed from the raw ground-truth/prediction arrays) across dynamic intent mapping, vs. an 84.0% zero-shot LLM baseline on the same samples — a modest, not dramatic, margin; standard cascaded LLM configurations experience prompt drift and decline under rapid conversational state transitions, but this dataset does not directly measure that decline.

### 6.3 Memory Surfacing and Recall
Standard RAG frameworks rely on static vector databases that are completely detached from conversational context, achieving low recall under dense loads. Under our neurobiologically inspired ACT-R graph architecture, episodic memories are dynamically weighted by **attentional weights, temporal power-law decay, and endocrine emotional congruence**.
As a result, AI Friend achieves an empirical **87.5% memory recall accuracy at Recall@5** (N=88 probes, independently recomputed and matching exactly) on dense graph search checks, resolving context omissions that lead to agentic confusion in legacy systems.
