"""
PersonaProfile — the surface through which a user authors their own friend.

Until now the knobs that decide *who the agent is* were split across two places
that were never meant to hold a personality. Narrative identity (name, values,
tone, adaptive traits) lived in `personality.json` and was already well-shaped,
with a genuine immutable/adaptive split. But **temperament** — the numbers that
decide how this particular mind actually feels and moves — lived in `Config`, a
process-global env-var singleton. That made emotional character a *deployment*
setting: one process, one personality, tuned by whoever wrote the `.env`.

This module makes temperament a persona concern. `Config` is demoted to
supplying defaults; a `PersonaProfile` carries the actual values and is injected
into `StateService`.

## The three tiers

Every field belongs to exactly one tier, declared in the schema rather than by
convention, so the boundary is enforceable and self-documenting:

- **IMMUTABLE** — safety and integrity invariants. Not user-settable *at all*.
  These are not in the model's fields; they live in `IMMUTABLE_CORE` below and
  are merged in at read time. A persona file that tries to set them is rejected
  with a warning rather than silently honoured, because a user-editable file
  must never be able to loosen a safety boundary.

- **CONSTITUTIONAL** — who this friend *constitutionally is*. The user sets these
  when creating the friend and they hold for its life: temperament baselines and
  the rates at which feeling moves. Changing them later does not "update" a
  friend so much as replace them with a different person, which is a decision
  worth making deliberately.

- **ADAPTIVE** — seeded by the user, then owned by the friend. The user chooses
  where the relationship *starts*; living together decides where it goes. Trust
  and attachment are the clearest cases: a friend who begins guarded may become
  close, and that trajectory belongs to the relationship, not to a config file.

## Why the ranges are narrower than the maths allows

Total configurability has a failure mode: a user can tune a friend into
something that is not recognisably alive. The bounds here are deliberately
tighter than the underlying variables permit, and each one exists to preserve a
specific property:

- `mood_decay_rate` is strictly positive. At zero, ALMA decay stops and the
  agent's mood locks permanently at whatever it last felt — a friend frozen
  mid-emotion.
- `baseline_valence` is capped at ±0.6, not ±1.0. A friend pinned at maximum
  valence can never be sad *with* you, which is not cheerfulness but absence.
- `baseline_arousal` and `baseline_dominance` keep headroom at both ends, so
  there is always room to be roused or calmed, to lead or to yield.

The through-line: **a personality may be shaped, but it must remain moveable.**
A configured friend that cannot be affected by what happens to it is a puppet,
not a character.

        `IdentityManager`'s file groups things under `core_personality`,
        `conversation_rules` and so on. That layout predates this schema and is
        what every existing install has on disk, so it is read rather than
        migrated: a user who authored a friend should not have to rewrite the
        file to keep it.

        Flat keys win where both are present, so a file may be written either
        way and a partially-migrated one still loads.

        The nested `immutable` block is dropped here for the same reason
        `_reject_immutable_overrides` drops the flat one — it is the exact path
        that let a user-editable file empty the safety boundaries. Only
        `base_tone` survives it, which is authorable by design.
