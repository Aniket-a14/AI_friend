"""
The persona compiler: freeform prose -> a validated `PersonaProfile` + biography.

Phase 2.1 of the community roadmap. A user describes their friend in their own
words ("she's blunt, hates small talk, gets genuinely annoyed when I dodge a
question, grew up somewhere cold") and this module turns that into the fields
`PersonaProfile` actually needs.

## Why numeric inference is split into two steps

The temperament fields (`baseline_valence`, `mood_decay_rate`, half-lives, ...)
are numbers a prose description does not contain. Asking the LLM to invent them
directly would make every inference an unaudited black box: two runs on the
same description could land on different numbers for no visible reason, and
there would be nothing for a preview screen (Phase 2.2) to actually explain.

So the LLM's job is narrower and more checkable: read the description and score
a small set of named, human-legible *dimensions* (warmth, volatility, how
quickly trust opens up, ...), each with a short quote or paraphrase from the
user's own text as evidence. Turning those dimensions into the actual bounded
`PersonaProfile` numbers is then a fixed set of linear formulas *in this file*
— inspectable, and tunable by editing a formula rather than re-prompting a
model and hoping the number moves the way you wanted.

Every dimension score therefore becomes exactly one `Inference`, with the field
it produced and a human-readable reason. `compile_persona` never applies a
numeric change silently.

## The friction requirement

The product decision (see the roadmap) is that a friend's edges come from what
the user wrote, not from a house style the compiler imposes. A description of
someone blunt must produce a blunt `base_tone`/`identity_summary`/`traits`, not
an agreeable default the model reached for out of habit. This is checked by
`backend/scripts/testing/verify_persona_compiler_friction.py`, a live-model
script (per this repo's `evals/`-style convention: it refuses to run silently
against `MOCK_LLM_TEXT`) run manually rather than as part of the hermetic
pytest suite, since it needs a real model's actual output to mean anything.

verbal habits, only if the description implies any -- else an empty list.
"avoid": a JSON list of at most 10 things this person would never say or do, \
only if the description implies any -- else an empty list.
"relationship": a short phrase (<=64 chars) for how they relate to the user, \
