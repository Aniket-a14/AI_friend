"""Provider-neutral LLM client surface (roadmap Phase 4.2).

Every `app/` construction site builds its client through `build_llm_client`
instead of importing `OllamaClient` directly, so the provider is a deployment
choice (`Config.LLM_PROVIDER`) rather than something baked into each call
site. `LLMClient` is the Protocol both `OllamaClient` and `AnthropicClient`
satisfy -- the four methods every caller in this codebase actually uses.

`backend/evals/` deliberately keeps constructing `OllamaClient` directly and
is not routed through this factory: its reproducibility story
(`runner.reset_model_state`) unloads and reloads a real local Ollama model
between runs, which has no cloud equivalent, and CLAUDE.md documents the
harness as probing "the LLM boundary" with a real `OllamaClient` on purpose.
