# Agent Context Ledger

This file is the persistent handoff note for agents working on this repository.
Read it before making architecture or behavior changes, and update it after every
meaningful change.

## Update Protocol

After an agent changes code, docs, tests, architecture, prompts, or runtime
behavior, append or update the relevant sections below.

Each update should include:

- Date and agent/session summary.
- Files changed.
- Behavior changed and why.
- Tests or verification run.
- Remaining risks or next recommended work.

Keep this file concise. It should preserve project intent and decision history,
not duplicate full diffs.

## System Intent

This project is a Cognitive Voice System (CVS), not a generic chatbot.

The target experience is a persistent human-like conversational identity with:

- Consistent identity over long sessions.
- Emotional continuity across turns and idle time.
- Natural timing, pauses, hesitation, pacing, and interruption behavior.
- Memory that surfaces organically rather than as rigid database recall.
- Local-first execution with modular agents connected through the NATS mesh.
- Future compatibility with robotics, without sacrificing current voice realism.

Core design principles:

- Perception-driven, not request-response.
- State-first, not prompt-first.
- Behavior emerges from internal state, identity, memory, and timing.
- Latency is measured by perceived conversational flow, especially first-audio
  response and interruption recovery.
- Components should stay replaceable and hardware-agnostic.

## Architecture Snapshot

Main runtime layers:

- Sensory layer: Whisper for final transcription, SenseVoice for fast perception,
  emotion, and speculative interruption.
- Cognitive layer: BDI-style `CognitiveService`, identity management, state
  service, action generation, and reflection.
- State layer: persistent mood, energy, trust, attachment, acoustic bias, and
  idle heartbeat evolution.
- Memory layer: Postgres/vector memory plus Neo4j graph state and relationships.
- Voice layer: GPT-SoVITS streaming PCM, temporal markers, filler audio, and
  NATS audio transport.
- Mesh: NATS JetStream subjects including `chat.*`, `audio.*`, `state.*`,
  `memory.*`, `system.*`, `voice.*`, and related channels.

## Recent Review Findings

The recent code review identified seven realism/continuity risks:

- State hydration used cached Neo4j reads and could rewind fresh mood/trust.
- Speculative pauses could not be rejected because fast STT did not publish
  structured intent to cognition.
- Reflection mutated a separate `IdentityManager` from the one used for replies.
- `BrainAgent.start()` could open two NATS connections by subscribing before
  explicit connection.
- `VoiceAgent` buffered full SoVITS output before playback, increasing perceived
  latency.
- Emotion XML/control wrappers could leak into spoken TTS text.
- Memory surfacing could repeatedly surface and refresh the same memory.

## 2026-04-19 CVS Runtime Fixes

Implemented fixes for the seven review findings.

Changed files:

- `backend/app/agents/brain_agent.py`
- `backend/app/agents/stt_agent.py`
- `backend/app/agents/surfacing_agent.py`
- `backend/app/agents/voice_agent.py`
- `backend/app/cognitive/action.py`
- `backend/app/cognitive/core.py`
- `backend/app/cognitive/identity.py`
- `backend/app/cognitive/learning.py`
- `backend/app/cognitive/state.py`
- `backend/app/knowledge/graph_db.py`
- `backend/app/memory_store.py`
- `backend/tests/test_regressions.py`

Behavior changes:

- `StateService.hydrate_state()` no longer uses cached graph reads for live agent
  state.
- `StateService.persist_state()` invalidates graph cache after writes.
- `GraphDB` exposes `invalidate_cache()` for stateful services.
- STT publishes structured speculative interruption hypotheses containing intent
  name, keywords, confidence, text, timestamp, and utterance ID.
- `CognitiveService` stores speculative intent, rejects false positives with
  `audio.resume`, confirms real stop commands with final `audio.stop`, and skips
  unnecessary per-turn state rehydration.
- `CognitiveService` and `ReflectionService` share one `IdentityManager`, so
  persona evolution affects active replies without restart.
- `BrainAgent` connects before cognitive subscriptions, avoiding split NATS
  connections.
- Brain segmentation no longer sleeps per word. It flushes based on semantic
  boundaries and a short adaptive formation window.
- `VoiceAgent` queues SoVITS PCM chunks as they arrive instead of waiting for
  full synthesis completion.
- `ActionService` strips legacy `<emotion ...>` wrappers while preserving
  `<pause=...>` and `<hesitate>` timing markers.
- Identity prompting now tells the model not to emit XML/emotion wrappers.
- Memory surfacing adds novelty suppression and disables passive recall refresh
  for surfaced memories.

Verification:

```powershell
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
```

Latest result:

- `48 passed`
- One non-blocking `.pytest_cache` permission warning remains.

## Current Test Environment Notes

Use the project-local backend virtual environment. The global Anaconda Python
environment could not import `nats` or activate `pytest-asyncio` reliably.

Preferred command:

```powershell
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
```

## Next Recommended Work

- Run a real voice session and measure perceived first-audio latency, speculative
  pause duration, false-positive resume latency, and memory surfacing frequency.
- Add structured affect/expression side-channel metadata so timing, affect,
  rate, and intensity do not depend on text markers.
- Add live session identity hydration from the durable database layer so JSON
  persona files are not the only active identity source.
- Add observability around `audio.stop`, `audio.resume`, `chat.output`, and
  `voice.segmentation_feedback` to evaluate natural conversation flow.
- Review the transport bridge with real LiveKit audio for frame sizing,
  backpressure, and overlap behavior.

## 2026-04-19 Documentation Refresh

Updated public documentation to better reflect the CVS runtime design and the
recent continuity fixes.

Changed files:

- `README.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/API_SPEC.md`
- `docs/IDENTITY_SYSTEM.md`
- `docs/LATENCY_IMPROVEMENT.md`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `docs/docker_verification.md`
- `docs/VOICE_CLONING.md`
- `docs/GPT_SOVITS_INSTALL.md`
- `docs/UPDATES.md`
- `.agents/CONTEXT.md`

Documentation changes:

- Added a docs map in `docs/README.md` so readers and future agents know where
  to start.
- Expanded the root README with CVS goals, runtime guarantees, current test
  command, documentation map, and updated roadmap.
- Updated architecture docs with live state safety, shared identity ownership,
  structured speculative interruption flow, streaming voice output, and memory
  novelty suppression.
- Updated API specs for `audio.perception`, speculative/final `audio.stop`,
  `audio.resume`, raw binary `audio.stream`, and the expression contract.
- Updated identity docs to explain runtime identity ownership, cache boundaries,
  affect metadata, and organic recall behavior.
- Updated latency docs to describe first-audio streaming, adaptive segmentation,
  Whisper validation, and behavioral latency metrics.
- Updated deployment and Docker verification docs with regression test commands
  and mesh subjects to monitor for interruption arbitration.
- Updated voice/GPT-SoVITS docs to describe chunk-first playback and the text
  vs expression boundary.
- Prepended `UPDATES.md` with the Apr 19 CVS runtime continuity fix summary.

Verification:

- `git diff --check` passed with only line-ending warnings.
- Documentation-only change; backend tests were not rerun during this docs pass.

## 2026-04-19 Runtime Latency and Continuity Fixes

Implemented the follow-up fixes from the architecture pass.

Changed files:

- `backend/app/agents/base.py`
- `backend/app/agents/transport_agent.py`
- `backend/app/agents/stt_agent.py`
- `backend/app/agents/brain_agent.py`
- `backend/app/agents/voice_agent.py`
- `backend/app/cognitive/core.py`
- `backend/app/cognitive/identity.py`
- `backend/app/cognitive/state.py`
- `backend/app/config.py`
- `backend/app/conversation_history_store.py`
- `backend/scripts/bench_latency.py`
- `backend/tests/test_regressions.py`
- `.agents/CONTEXT.md`

Behavior changes:

- `BaseAgent.publish()` now accepts explicit metadata for binary subjects.
- `TransportAgent` publishes inbound LiveKit audio as raw PCM bytes with metadata
  headers instead of base64 JSON.
- `STTAgent` queues Whisper and SenseVoice work on bounded workers so NATS audio
  callbacks do not block on transcription or perception inference.
- STT, cognition, brain, and voice now propagate utterance/turn correlation so
  speculative `audio.stop`, `audio.resume`, and final stops can be fenced.
- `VoiceAgent` increments a generation on final stop, drains queues with proper
  `task_done()` accounting, ignores stale resume events, drops stale synthesis
  chunks, and uses a sequence number in its priority queue.
- `BrainAgent` connects before cognitive subscriptions, avoiding split NATS
  connections.
- `IdentityManager` can hydrate from and persist back to `agent_configs`, making
  JSON files seed/export storage rather than the only active runtime identity
  source.
- `StateService` now confidence-gates acoustic emotion updates, uses a lower
  confidence-scaled sensory weight, and debounces Neo4j persistence for repeated
  400ms perception chunks.
- `bench_latency.py` understands binary `audio.stream` payloads.

Verification:

```powershell
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall app tests
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
```

Latest result:

- `54 passed`
- One non-blocking `.pytest_cache` permission warning remains.

Remaining risks:

- Real LiveKit/SoVITS session testing is still needed to validate frame sizing,
  perceived first-audio latency, stop/resume timing, and stale synthesis fencing
  under live audio pressure.

## 2026-04-19 Docker Infrastructure Hardening

Hardened the production container orchestration to support the 'Solid State' mesh requirements.

Changed files:

- `backend/Dockerfile`
- `.env.example`
- `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- `docker-compose.infra.yml`

Infrastructure changes:

- **Phased Startup Mesh**: Implemented `depends_on` conditions with `service_healthy`. The mesh now graduates in stages (Infra -> Brain -> Sensory Agents) to eliminate startup race conditions.
- **Mesh Surveillance**: Added `netcat-openbsd` to the base image. All agents now perform automated health probes (`nc -z nats_mesh 4222`) to monitor signal bus connectivity.
- **Performance Exposure**: Mapped CVS-1.0 performance variables (`VOICE_SYNTH_CONCURRENCY`, `MAX_VOICE_QUEUE_SIZE`, `STT_WHISPER_QUEUE_SIZE`, `STATE_SENSORY_WEIGHT`) to the `.env` layer for production tuning.
- **Identity Persistence**: Synchronized weight volumes (`GPT_weights`, `SoVITS_weights`) across the agent mesh to support permanent voice identity.
- **Resilience**: Orchestrated SoVITS API health diagnostics using `/docs` probes to ensure dependent agents only start when the inference engine is ready.

Verification:

- `docker compose -f ...infra.yml -f ...prod.yml up -d`
- `docker ps` confirmed all agents reached `Healthy` status (with Voice Agent auto-starting after SoVITS settled).
