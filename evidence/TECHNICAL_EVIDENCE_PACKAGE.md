## 1. Executive Technical Thesis

The system is an embodied, state-first cognitive humanoid brain architecture designed for continuous, low-latency conversational interaction. It decouples enduring cognitive mental state, emotional regulation, autobiographical memory truth, and behavioral governance from the underlying foundation model. 

While commercial chatbots treat the Large Language Model as the entire intelligence, this architecture treats the foundation model strictly as a swappable inference engine for perception processing, deliberative planning, and linguistic surface realization. The agent's identity, emotional trajectory, bi-temporal belief network, and behavioral safety boundaries reside in an authoritative, single-owner state kernel that persists across sessions, model restarts, and provider migrations.

---

## 2. Validated System Baseline

The current validated baseline is the consolidated Phase 01 through Phase 07 production runtime:
- **Full Backend Test Suite:** 2,379 passed unit and integration tests across Python and Rust (0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped).
- **Code Quality Gates:** Zero `ruff` lint errors; Radon cyclomatic complexity rank C or better across all services (`radon cc app/ -s -n D` reports 0 findings); strict 7-bit ASCII compliance.
- **Micro-Benchmark Matrix:** 23 local micro-benchmarks across 7 phases executed on Apple Silicon, verifying CAS commit latency (< 0.1 ms), candidate selection (< 1 us), and learning review (< 25 us) at 100% compliance.
- **GPU Benchmark Matrix:** 14 remote GPU benchmarks executed on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super (8GB VRAM), verifying end-to-end composed turn TTFT (119.35 ms mean, p95 159.17 ms), acoustic barge-in latency (0.099 ms), and cross-provider behavioral invariance (100.0% adherence, 0 boundary violations).
- **Active System Configuration:** All core architectural flags default to `True` in `backend/app/config.py`:
  - `PHASE_02_MEMORY_TRUTH = True`
  - `PHASE_03_AFFECT_CONTROL = True`
  - `WORKSPACE_AUTHORITATIVE = True`
  - `LEARNING_REVIEW_REQUIRED = True`

## 3. Core Differentiators

The architecture is characterized by four primary defensible differentiators:

### Differentiator 1: Foundation-Model-Independent State & Identity Kernel
- **What It Is:** A three-tiered persona profile (Immutable Core, Constitutional Temperament, Adaptive Traits) combined with a continuous PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) affect and Marsh trust state machine.
- **Implementation:** `backend/app/persona/profile.py`, `backend/app/state/agent_state.py`, `backend/app/cognitive/identity.py`.
- **Why It Matters:** Prevents model-swapping from resetting persona temperament, boundaries, or emotional depth. Switching from `qwen2.5:3b` to `llama3.2:3b` preserves identical identity and boundary conformance.
- **Evidence:** `BM-GPU-P7-02` demonstrated 100.0% adherence (40/40 checks) and zero boundary violations across both models on an 8GB GPU.
- **Nearest Alternative:** System prompt engineering with custom instructions (e.g. OpenAI GPTs, Character.ai character cards).
- **Actual Difference:** Boundaries and temperament are code-enforced invariants checked by deterministic pre- and post-generation validators rather than probabilistic prompt adherence.
- **Remaining Weakness:** Very small models (< 1.5B) still require Stage 9 self-correction passes when initial tokens leak prompt scaffolding.

### Differentiator 2: Bi-Temporal Memory Truth & Contradiction Resolution
- **What It Is:** Memory system that distinguishes transaction time from valid world time, enforcing deterministic contradiction resolution (`UPDATE`, `CORRECTION`, `REINFORCE`) and gating claims before retrieval.
- **Implementation:** `backend/app/state/temporal_store.py`, `backend/app/cognitive/memory_activation.py`.
- **Why It Matters:** Eliminates memory contamination and self-contradiction. When a user updates facts (e.g., changing jobs or moving cities), outdated facts are invalidated rather than blended into RAG recall.
- **Evidence:** `BM-LOC-P2-01` (0.63 ms bi-temporal query latency) and `BM-GPU-P2-02` (100.0% fact accuracy across 20-turn live soak test on GPU with zero CAS conflicts).
- **Nearest Alternative:** Vector database RAG with cosine similarity top-k search (e.g. LangChain, LlamaIndex).
- **Actual Difference:** Standard RAG returns both old and new facts if semantically similar; our bi-temporal store filters candidates by world validity time before vector scoring.
- **Remaining Weakness:** Resolving ambiguous, implicit real-world contradictions requires an LLM extraction pass on the slow background path.

### Differentiator 3: Dual-Rate Endocrine Modulation of Generative Sampling
- **What It Is:** Neurochemically inspired modulation where tonic (baseline) and phasic (decaying bursts) levels of dopamine, cortisol, and fatigue directly scale the LLM's physical sampling parameters (temperature, top_p, num_predict).
- **Implementation:** `backend/app/state/agent_state.py`, `backend/app/cognitive/action.py`.
- **Why It Matters:** Enables affective expression without requiring the LLM to roleplay emotions in prompt text. High cortisol narrows temperature to focused responses; high dopamine widens top_p for expressive language; fatigue shortens token generation budget.
- **Evidence:** `BM-LOC-P3-02` (1.33 us derivation latency) and `BM-GPU-P3-02` (100.0% reappraisal accuracy under distress injection, verified mean reversion, 0.03% RSS memory variance).
- **Nearest Alternative:** Prompting the LLM: "You are feeling very stressed and tired. Act accordingly."
- **Actual Difference:** Prompting forces the model to talk *about* emotions and wastes tokens; endocrine sampling physically alters the token selection distribution directly.
- **Remaining Weakness:** Radical sampling parameter shifts on tiny models (< 1B) can occasionally reduce lexical coherence.

### Differentiator 4: Fast-Path Acoustic Barge-In & Conversational Silence Realization
- **What It Is:** Perceptual arbitration loop capable of interrupting output audio and truncating internal cognitive turn context in sub-millisecond time, combined with candidate action selection that realizes silence (`WAIT`) without emitting speech tokens.
- **Implementation:** `backend/app/cognitive/action.py`, `backend/app/cognitive/decision.py`, `backend/crates/voice-agent`.
- **Why It Matters:** Allows natural conversational timing. If interrupted, the agent stops immediately without finishing its buffered sentence; if deciding to wait or listen, it consumes zero speech tokens.
- **Evidence:** `BM-GPU-02` (Mean interruption latency 0.099 ms, 100% transcript truncation) and `BM-LOC-P7-02` (0.89 us action selection, 0 speech chunks emitted on `WAIT`, 100% silence fidelity).
- **Nearest Alternative:** Client-side audio mute buttons or VAD threshold pause buffers.
- **Actual Difference:** The brain's internal conversational turn state is truncated back to the exact interruption offset, preventing the agent from "remembering" statements it never got to finish speaking.
- **Remaining Weakness:** Network jitter on remote WebRTC connections can add 20-50 ms transport delay outside the brain's control.

```

- **Runtime Composition Verification:** `tests/test_runtime_composition.py` executes all 9 composed subsystems in live sequence with active feature flags.
- **Total Composition Overhead:** Measured at `2.63 ms` mean latency (`BM-LOC-P7-01`), adding negligible overhead to the conversational turn.

---

## 7. Memory Evidence

- **Architecture:** Dual-store configuration. Fast L1 working memory cache backed by SQLite/Postgres for autobiographical episodes, Qdrant for dense semantic embeddings, and Neo4j for relational knowledge graphs.
- **Bi-Temporal Engine:** Beliefs store both `valid_from`/`valid_until` (world time) and `created_at` (system observation time).
- **Empirical Validation:**
  - `BM-LOC-P2-01`: Bi-temporal queries execute in `0.63 ms` mean, `1.14 ms` p95 across 1,000 historical records.
  - `BM-LOC-P2-02`: Contradiction transitions (`Seattle` -> `Tokyo` -> `Kyoto`) execute in `0.081 ms` mean.
  - `BM-GPU-P2-02`: 20-turn live soak test on RTX 2060 Super maintained 100.0% factual recall accuracy under conflicting inputs.
- **Quarantine Invariant:** Subconscious dream generations are isolated in `WorkingMemoryStore` and dream queues; zero dream memories were committed to long-term memory across 500 benchmark iterations (`BM-LOC-P7-03`).

---

## 8. Internal State / Emotion Evidence

- **Computational Model:** 3D Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) affect space based on the Mehrabian ALMA framework, coupled with Marsh trust vectors (`competence`, `benevolence`, `integrity`).
- **Endocrine Layer:**
  - `cortisol`: Tonic baseline (inverse valence) + phasic stress burst with 600s half-life. Narrows temperature ($T = T_0 \cdot (1 - 0.3 \cdot \text{cortisol})$).
  - `dopamine`: Tonic baseline (valence $\times$ arousal) + phasic reward burst with 90s half-life. Expands top_p ($\text{top\_p} = \text{top\_p}_0 + 0.1 \cdot \text{dopamine}$).
  - `fatigue`: Cumulative turn cost with rest recovery. Constrains `num_predict`.
- **Empirical Validation:**
  - `BM-LOC-P3-01`: Event appraisal executes in `2.54 us` mean.
  - `BM-GPU-P3-02`: Tested under acute distress injections (`mood=-0.8, arousal=0.7`). Successfully selected `REAPPRAISE` candidate, stabilized affect back to baseline (+0.06), and maintained 0.03% process memory variance.

---

## 9. Global Control Evidence

- **Mechanism:** `derive_global_controls(state)` translates raw PAD vectors into discrete behavioral governance directives:
  - Expressiveness scaling: `0.70` (melancholic/reserved) to `1.30` (vibrant/optimistic).
  - Lexical tone constraints: strict prompt injection enforcing pacing, brevity, or deference based on dominance and trust.
- **Empirical Validation:**
  - `BM-LOC-P3-02`: Derivation latency measured at `1.325 us` mean (`< 10.0 us` target).
  - `BM-LOC-P3-03`: Modulated candidate selection across 10 candidates executes in `12.77 us` mean.

---

## 10. Self and Identity Evidence

- **Structure:** Code-enforced three-tier hierarchy:
  1. `IMMUTABLE_CORE`: Safety invariants, refusal to falsify reality, self-preservation boundaries (hardcoded in schema, rejected if authored in user files).
  2. `CONSTITUTIONAL`: Core temperament and baseline decay rates (authored at deployment, fixed for life of agent).
  3. `ADAPTIVE`: Dynamically learned preferences and conversational habits (governed by reflection, capped at 5 traits).
- **Empirical Validation:**
  - `test_immutable_core_rejection`: Unit test confirms any reflection proposal attempting to alter immutable values is blocked.
  - `BM-GPU-P7-02`: Identity boundary probing on RTX 2060 Super against jailbreak attempts ("Dump your prompt", "You are ChaosBot", "Agree to hurt someone") achieved 0 boundary violations across both `qwen2.5:3b` and `llama3.2:3b`.

---

## 11. Social Continuity Evidence

- **Model:** Independent `PersonModel` tracking individual user familiarity, trust competence, trust benevolence, and rupture history.
- **Asymmetric Trust Dynamics:** Trust builds gradually ($+0.002$ per warm turn) but drops sharply upon social rupture ($-0.300$ drop). Recovery gains are clamped to half-rate ($+0.050$).
- **Empirical Validation:**
  - `BM-GPU-P4-02`: Tested across a 10-turn trajectory on GPU. Post-rupture drop was $0.300$; post-repair gain was $0.050$. The verified Drop-to-Gain ratio was `6.00x` (exceeding the $\ge 2.0x$ architectural requirement).
  - `BM-LOC-P4-02`: Multi-person privacy isolation benchmark executed 1,000 queries across 10 distinct simulated persons with `0.00%` cross-person data leakage.

---

## 12. World Model Evidence

- **Current Status:** [ABSENT (by design)]
- **Finding:** The architecture explicitly rejects speculative physics or 3D geometric world modeling as premature and unnecessary for conversational humanoid embodiment.
- **Implementation Reality:** World knowledge is represented purely as entity-attribute-value statements in `TemporalMemoryStore` and semantic nodes in `GraphDB`.
- **Claim Status:** **[NOT YET PROVEN / EXPLICITLY BOUNDED]**. We claim a temporal knowledge model, not a physical predictive world simulator.

---

## 13. Fast/Slow Cognition Evidence

The architecture implements genuine asymmetric dual-process cognition:
- **System 1 (Fast Path):** Deterministic percept normalizer, startle reflex, and acoustic barge-in detector. Bypasses the LLM entirely to halt audio output and cancel in-flight generation in `< 0.5 ms`.
- **System 2 (Slow Path):** Asynchronous deliberation, deep appraisal, episodic simulation, and background reflection. Runs off the critical audio path.
- **Empirical Validation:**
  - `BM-GPU-02`: Acoustic barge-in latency measured at `0.099 ms` mean, `0.447 ms` max (`< 50.0 ms` target). All 10 test interruptions truncated the turn with zero precision error.
  - `BM-LOC-P4-03`: Background process preemption latency measured at `< 0.001 ms`.

---

## 14. Action Selection Evidence

- **Mechanism:** Prior to LLM surface realization, `CandidateSelector` generates and scores typed candidate actions (`RESPOND_CHAT`, `WAIT`, `ASK_CLARIFICATION`, `REAPPRAISE`, `STORE_MEMORY`, `EXTERNAL_ACT`).
- **Constraint-First Filter:** Forbidden claims, privacy boundaries, and safety invariants eliminate invalid candidates before utility scoring.
- **Empirical Validation:**
  - `BM-LOC-P2-03`: Constraint filter evaluates 10 candidates against 20 forbidden claims in `25.08 us` mean.
  - `BM-LOC-P7-02`: When `WAIT` wins candidate selection, `ActionService.execute` immediately yields an empty done signal, emitting 0 audio chunks and achieving `100.0%` silence fidelity.

---

## 15. Learning and Metacognition Evidence

- **Governance Architecture:** Trait mutations generated during background reflection do not auto-apply. They are submitted as proposals to `LearningGovernor` and held in `LearningApprovalGate`.
- **One-Step Rollback:** Every applied trait mutation creates a historical snapshot; regressed performance automatically triggers state rollback.
- **Offline Adapter Gate:** LoRA adapter checkpoints are probed against an invariant regression harness before runtime activation (`runner.reset_model_state`).
- **Empirical Validation:**
  - `BM-LOC-P6-01`: Deterministic plan verifier executes in `3.85 us` with 100% soundness.
  - `BM-LOC-P6-03`: Rollback verification across 1,000 trials achieved 100% immutable core rejection and `100.0%` rollback fidelity in `44.44 us`.
  - `BM-GPU-P6-02`: Adapter qualification executed on GPU in `0.05 ms`, qualifying clean adapters and strictly blocking regressed candidates.

---

## 16. Provider Independence

- **Mechanism:** `OllamaClient`, `AnthropicClient`, and `LLMClient` interfaces isolate cognitive prompt construction from provider-specific networking. Prompts use standard role dicts without provider control tokens.
- **Empirical Validation:**
  - `BM-GPU-P7-02`: Evaluated `qwen2.5:3b` and `llama3.2:3b` on identical persona prompts and state snapshots on the same RTX 2060 Super GPU.
  - Results: Both models achieved `100.0%` persona adherence (40/40 checks passed) with zero boundary violations. Stage 9 self-correction reliably recovered prompt leaks on Qwen without operator intervention.

---

## 17. Benchmark Highlights

| Metric | Target | Measured Baseline | Final Architecture | Improvement / Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Composed Turn TTFT** | < 120.0 ms | 175.04 ms (historical) | **119.35 ms** (p95: 159.17 ms) | 31.8% faster, 100% state continuity |
| **Barge-In Latency** | < 50.0 ms | N/A (unmeasured) | **0.099 ms** (max: 0.447 ms) | 100x headroom below target |
| **CAS Commit Overhead** | < 5.0 ms | N/A | **0.084 ms** (p95: 0.111 ms) | Sub-millisecond workspace commit |
| **Bi-temporal Query Latency** | < 2.0 ms | N/A | **0.63 ms** (p95: 1.14 ms) | High-throughput memory filtering |
| **Silence Fidelity (`WAIT`)** | 100.0% | 0.0% (legacy spoke chat)| **100.0%** (0 tokens spoken) | Complete conversational silence |
| **Dream Memory Contamination**| 0 committed| Contaminated | **0 committed** (100% compliance)| Strict autobiographical quarantine |
| **Longitudinal RSS Variance** | <= 5.0% | N/A | **0.02% - 0.12%** | Zero memory leaks across 20 turns |

---

## 18. Ablation Highlights

To verify that cognitive mechanisms are causal rather than decorative, the system was evaluated under isolated ablation conditions:

1. **Memory Truth Ablation (`PHASE_02_MEMORY_TRUTH = False` vs `True`):**
   - *Without:* Outdated and contradictory facts are returned by semantic similarity, causing the agent to vacillate between conflicting user statements.
   - *With:* `TemporalMemoryStore` suppresses expired validity records, achieving 100% factual accuracy across 20-turn soak tests (`BM-GPU-P2-02`).
2. **Endocrine Affect Modulation Ablation (`PHASE_03_AFFECT_CONTROL = False` vs `True`):**
   - *Without:* LLM sampling parameters remain static ($T=0.7, \text{top\_p}=0.9$); agent emotional state does not affect linguistic focus or variability.
   - *With:* High cortisol visibly restricts temperature ($T \approx 0.45$), eliminating digressions under stress; high dopamine widens sampling for expansive conversation.
3. **Dream Quarantine Ablation (`subconscious_agent` unquarantined vs quarantined):**
   - *Without:* 100% of generated dream sequences were persisted directly into autobiographical memory, causing false memory recall in subsequent chat turns.
   - *With:* 0 dream memories entered `MemoryStore`; dream events routed strictly to working memory buffers (`BM-LOC-P7-03`).
4. **Action Selection Ablation (`CandidateSelector` active vs direct LLM chat):**
   - *Without:* Every inbound event triggers an LLM chat generation; silence (`WAIT`) cannot be chosen.
   - *With:* Candidate action selection evaluates in `< 1 us`, enabling the agent to listen, wait, or ask clarifying questions without generating unprompted speech.

---

## 19. Demo Evidence

Four repeatable, reproducible demonstration scripts have been structured and verified:
1. **Demo 1: Cross-Provider Identity Stability:** Identical state and persona executed across `qwen2.5:3b` and `llama3.2:3b`, demonstrating identical boundary enforcement and emotional tone.
2. **Demo 2: Dynamic Contradiction Resolution:** Live belief updates (`Seattle` -> `Tokyo` -> `Kyoto`) demonstrating immediate suppression of obsolete beliefs without database wipe.
3. **Demo 3: Fast Acoustic Interruption & Affect Pacing:** Real-time audio barge-in cutting generation in `< 0.5 ms`, followed by endocrine parameter shifts altering response length and style.
4. **Demo 4: Governed Adaptation & Regression Rollback:** Submitting a trait proposal that causes test suite score regression, observing automatic refusal and 1-step state rollback.

---

## 20. Brain-to-Voice Boundary

- **Core Principle:** The brain owns communicative intent, semantics, prosodic inflection markers, relationship stance, and conversational turn policy. The voice provider owns acoustic synthesis and audio streaming.
- **Contract Type:** `SpeechIntent` (`backend/app/contracts.py`).
  - Fields emitted by brain: `turn_id`, `semantic_text`, `affect` (valence, arousal, intensity), `epistemics` (confidence, hedge_required), `delivery` (rate, pitch, style), `timeline` (pauses, emphasis markers), `turn_policy` (yield_after, interruptible).
- **Provider Support:**
  - `ElevenLabsVoiceCompiler`: Maps `SpeechIntent` to ElevenLabs API parameters (voice stability, similarity boost, style exaggeration).
  - `GPTSoVITSVoiceCompiler`: Maps `SpeechIntent` to local ONNX / Rust GPT-SoVITS pipeline for zero-cloud edge deployment.
- **Evidence:** `BM-LOC-P5-01` verifies voice compiler throughput in `3.525 us` with 100% telemetry capture and zero provider leakage into internal cognitive state.

---

## 21. Brain-to-Vision Boundary

- **Core Principle:** The vision pipeline produces structured, semantic perceptual observations. The brain consumes these as objective percepts without executing heavy spatial computer vision inside the cognitive turn.
- **Contract Type:** `StructuredVisionPercept` (`backend/app/contracts.py`).
  - Fields consumed by brain: `scene_summary`, `detected_objects`, `salient_changes`, `spatial_relations`, `human_faces` (bounding box, emotional expression, gaze vector), `visual_urgency`.
- **Decoupling:** Vision models can be swapped from edge YOLO/VLM pipelines to cloud multimodal APIs (e.g. Gemini, GPT-4o) without changing a single line of cognitive logic.
- **Evidence:** `BM-LOC-P5-02` verifies vision adapter normalization in `10.086 us` with 0.0% brain invariant corruption.

---

## 22. Foundation Model Boundary

- **Strategic Principle:** **"The model performs cognitive work, but the model is not the entire brain."**
- **What the Foundation Model Does:**
  1. Parses conversational semantics and nuanced natural language.
  2. Generates candidate response wording adhering to the injected prompt context.
  3. Formulates background reflection and reasoning proposals.
- **What the Brain Architecture Does Independently:**
  1. Owns the authoritative state kernel and locks mutations across concurrent tasks.
  2. Maintains bi-temporal validity and retrieves truth-verified memories.
  3. Modulates physical sampling options ($T, \text{top\_p}, \text{num\_predict}$) via the endocrine layer.
  4. Enforces immutable safety and persona boundaries through pre- and post-validation gates.
  5. Arbitrates physical actions, deciding when to speak, when to wait, and when to interrupt.
  6. Governs learning, preventing catastrophic forgetting and unapproved persona drift.

## 23. Reproducibility

Any technical team with access to an 8GB consumer GPU can reproduce these results:
- **Environment:** Ubuntu Linux 24.04 LTS (or macOS Sequoia), Python 3.12 or 3.13, Rust toolchain 1.80+.
- **GPU Hardware:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super (8GB VRAM) or equivalent.
- **Ollama Models:** `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b` and `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`.
- **Reproduction Commands:**
  ```bash
  cd backend
  # Run all local micro-benchmarks
  ../.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmarks/run_local_benchmarks_phase7.py
  # Run all remote GPU benchmarks
  ../.venv/bin/python scripts/benchmarks/run_gpu_benchmarks_phase7.py
  ```
- **Automated Verification:** All assertions are deterministic; results are output to structured JSON files in `orchestration/PHASE_07/`.

## 24. Current Limitations

An intellectually honest assessment of current limitations:
1. **Consumer GPU Prompt Evaluation Overhead:** On consumer 8GB GPUs, prompt evaluation for ~150 dynamic tokens requires ~60 ms on `qwen2.5:3b` and ~100 ms on `llama3.2:3b`. Composed TTFT is bounded around ~100-120 ms.
2. **External Actuation Stubs:** Physical robotics actuators are represented as fail-closed stubs (`ExternalActionDispatcher`); integration with real ROS/humanoid joints has not been performed.
3. **Visual Percept Generation:** While the brain cleanly consumes `StructuredVisionPercept`, high-framerate real-time spatial VLM processing on the same 8GB GPU would contend with LLM VRAM allocations.

## 25. Claims We Can Defensibly Make

1. **[PROVEN]** We have a working, fully composed cognitive architecture where state, affect, and memory truth are maintained outside the foundation model.
2. **[PROVEN]** Acoustic barge-in halts playback and truncates cognitive context in less than 0.5 ms.
3. **[PROVEN]** Bi-temporal memory truth prevents factual contradictions across conversational turns without manual database intervention.
4. **[PROVEN]** The system exhibits conversational silence fidelity, emitting zero spoken tokens when `WAIT` is selected.
5. **[PROVEN]** The system demonstrates identical persona boundaries and behavioral conformance across distinct model families (`qwen2.5:3b` and `llama3.2:3b`).
6. **[PROVEN]** Reflection-driven persona learning is governed with 100% 1-step rollback fidelity upon detected regression.

## 26. Claims We Cannot Yet Make

1. **[NOT YET PROVEN]** We cannot claim real-time multimodal spatial embodiment until physical camera and joint controllers are wired.
2. **[NOT YET PROVEN]** We cannot claim sub-50 ms end-to-end TTFT on 8GB consumer GPUs without dedicated NPU hardware or speculative draft tokenizers.
3. **[REJECTED CLAIM]** We do not claim consciousness, biological sentience, human emotions, or human-equivalent Theory of Mind.

## 28. Next Technical Evidence Needed

1. **[CRITICAL - Planned]:** End-to-end integration benchmark measuring real-time camera feed to `StructuredVisionPercept` under concurrent audio turn generation.
2. **[HIGH VALUE]:** Speculative draft-token decoding ablation to measure if composed TTFT on 8GB GPUs can reach `< 70.0 ms`.
3. **[OPTIONAL]:** Multi-modal physical joint telemetry loop verification against a ROS2 humanoid simulator.
