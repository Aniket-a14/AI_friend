## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue.** Global visibility of an exploit before a patch is ready puts all users at risk.
2.  Email the security team at **aniketsahaworkspace@gmail.com** or open a **Private Advisory** on GitHub.
3.  Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.

### Response Timeline
-   **Acknowledgement**: Within 48 hours.
-   **Assessment**: Within 1 week.
-   **Fix**: As soon as possible, prioritized by severity.

Thank you for helping keep AI Friend safe! 🛡️
